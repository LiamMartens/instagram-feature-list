# Instagram Feature List
Here you will find several instagram accounts per category which you can tag to potentially gain exposure. This is by no means an extensive list but will grow as time goes on. At the time of writing there are more than 100 accounts listed here in several categories.

## Contributing
Feel free to create a PR  with new or updated accounts. Keep in mind you can use some of the `node` scripts for maintaining the followcounts etc... (you will find these scripts inside `.scripts`)
* `npm run detect-removed`: Checks for accounts that don't exist anymore
* `npm run detect-doubles`: Checks for accounts that exist in multiple categories
* `npm run sync-all`: Syncs the followcounts of all categories
* `npm run sync-followers [path to .md file]`: Syncs the followcounts of a single `.md` file
